# Portfolio

Welcome to my online portfolio. This is a collection of the projects I've worked on, both solo and collaboratively. This portfolio
will be updated periodically as I complete projects as part of the Carleton University Bootcamp, and onwards. Feel free to reach 
out to discuss anything here.
